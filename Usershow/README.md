# API requests: The Fake Api can manage 200 request per day  

Change the url if needed:  
Url 1: (https://my.api.mockaroo.com/animal.json?key=fb0a3040)  
Url 2: (https://my.api.mockaroo.com/animal_color.json?key=c5a2bc40)

The url needs to be changed in both the pages

Note: the api are dynamic so data will be different on both the pages each time the request is made.
